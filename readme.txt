**Why another Social Sharing Button?**

* Not all but most of social sharing plugins are not optimized for your need
* They may load social sharing icons individually which increased unnecessary HTTP requests to your server
* If you are using official social sharing buttons then it loads Java Script for each Sharing button which eventually impacts your page load speed significantly
* If your page speed is high, your site will rank high in Google Search
* If your page speed is high, there are more chances users will return to your site more frequently as it’s smooth experience for them

* There is no point to load java scripts on each and every page on your site. <a href="https://crunchify.com/how-to-create-social-sharing-button-without-any-plugin-and-script-loading-wordpress-speed-optimization-goal/">more detailed info</a>.
